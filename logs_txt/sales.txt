sales test
3 demos scheduled today: two SMBs and one enterprise lead from last week’s webinar. :raised_hands: Will drop notes in Salesforce after each.
Just added 12 new prospects to the pipeline from ProductHunt launch — lots of interest in the analytics features.
Awesome momentum! Reminder: Q2 goals are up 18% — let’s keep pushing on outbound touches this week. Also, please update Close by EOD.
Closed the deal with CloudPilot! $22k ARR. Their CTO loved our real-time dashboarding. :champagne:
Nice work!! That’s huge.
Just booked a call with one of the speakers from SaaSConnect. Says they’re evaluating 3 vendors — we’re in the running!
Funnel conversion looking good — 17% demo-to-close rate this week. Let’s aim to tighten follow-ups, especially on the 24–48 hour window.
Agreed. Had two prospects ghost after really good demos — going to test a new email follow-up format. Will share template in #sales-templates.
